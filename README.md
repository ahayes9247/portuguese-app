## Introduction

This project is a database of tools for learning European Portuguese. It is a personal project born 
from my passion for the Portuguese language and culture. It aims to address the frustrations that many 
people interested in European Portuguese (not Brazilian Portuguese) face: not knowing where to find 
resources that teach European Portuguese. 

While many books, apps, and other materials exist for learning 
Brazilian Portuguese, materials focused on European Portuguese are relatively scarce outside of Portugal. 
This contrast is mainly due to Brazil's significantly larger population and global influence, and is thus 
understandable. However, it is still a pain point for non-native Portuguese speakers who would like to 
visit, live, or work in Portugal.

Although this project cannot make up for the overall lack of resources outside of Portugal, it 
can tell people where to find what is available. I learned to read, write, and speak the 
European variant of Portuguese very well while living outside of Portugal, and often receive 
praise for my accent and grammar within Portugal. I now want to pass on the resources that helped me 
to others.

### Tech Stack

To achieve that goal, this project uses the following tech stack:
* React
* JavaScript
* HTML5
* CSS3
* REST APIs

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
